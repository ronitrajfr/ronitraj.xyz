import Link from "../../components/Link.vue";
import Code from "../../components/Code.vue";
import { createHeading } from "../../components/Heading";

export const components = {
  a: Link,
  code: Code,
  h1: createHeading("h1"),
  h2: createHeading("h2"),
  h3: createHeading("h3"),
};

how I built my first project [preve](http://preve.onrender.com) and how it feels to make your very first product.

So I had no idea what to build or how to build it until I had a chance to meet with 
[@abhirajsinha](https://x.com/@_abhirajsinha_). Guess what? 
He gave me an excellent idea: to build a chatbot for a specific use case.
After thinking of it over for a day, I decided to create a "PDF summarizer" chatbot.

With full motivation to build my first product,
I started working on Preve. It was quite challenging at first,
but with excellent support which I got from my friends and inspiration from 
other product builders on Twitter, I didn't stop and finally built it.

How does it feel? To be honest, it was an amazing experience,
and I learned a lot from this project. I got 50+ users in one day 
and over 70 PDF uploads, which felt great! People are liking it.
I discovered many bugs after the launch and am still working 
on making it even better.

~ Thank you!
